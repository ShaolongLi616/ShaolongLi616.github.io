Hi! I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Central South University and am currently spending my gap year doing research and internships. I earned my degree in June 2024.

Nowadays I work as a Research Assistant at [AIMING Lab (Adaptive Intelligence through Alignment, Interaction and Learning), UNC-Chapel Hill](https://www.huaxiuyao.io/aiming-lab) with [Prof. Huaxiu Yao](https://www.huaxiuyao.io/). Previously, I conducted research at Tsinghua University under the supervision of [Prof. Longbo Huang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~huang/).

My research interests primarily focus on:
1. AI alignment and preference learning (e.g., RLHF, DPO).
2. Mathematical reasoning and computational efficiency in large language models.
3. Reinforcement learning.
I'm also open to discussing other topics. If you're interested in chatting with me, please feel free to reach out!

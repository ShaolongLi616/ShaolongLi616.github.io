I am currently spending a gap year doing research and internships before starting the M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (Fall 2025). I earned my B.S. in Computer Science and Technology from Central South University in June 2024.

Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant at UNC-Chapel Hill, advised by [Prof. Huaxiu Yao](https://www.huaxiuyao.io/). Before that, I conducted research at Tsinghua University under the supervision of [Prof. Longbo Huang](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~huang/).

My research interests primarily focus on:
1. Multimodal learning and foundation models (e.g., LLMs, VLMs).
2. AI alignment and preference learning (e.g., RLHF, DPO, RLAIF).
3. Mathematical reasoning and computational efficiency in large language models.
4. Multi-agent reinforcement learning.

I'm also open to discussing other topics. If you're interested in chatting with me, please feel free to reach out!

My hobbies are very diverse, including sports, movies, anime, and music. 

In particular, I am a faithful fan of badminton, and my favorite athlete is Lin Dan. After entering university, I joined the college badminton team and started training weekly. I enjoy collecting rackets used by famous players, such as N901 and VTZF. Welcome anyone to come and exchange badminton skills with me.
